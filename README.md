# Analysis 

Looking at the screenshots of each of the waveforms, it is obvious that they both show the same data which means that both were indeed coded correctly.  

# Decoder

The device created is called a decoder.  A decoder is a circuit type that will convert binary information from n number of input lines to a maximum of 2^n output lines.  Decoders are used in such applications such as multiplexing which converts coded inputs into coded outputs.
